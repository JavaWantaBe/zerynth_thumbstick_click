Thumbstick Click
================

Thumbstick click is a high precision input device. It features a dual axis, spring return, pushbutton enabled joystick 
(similar to the ones used on joypads on popular gaming consoles), and a MCP3204 12-bit A/D converter. The joystick unit 
receives directional input in the x and y axes by way of two potentiometers connected to a stick. The mechanical pushbutton 
sends an interrupt signal to the microcontroller. Thumbstick click communicates with the target board through mikroBUSÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 
SPI (CS, SCK, MISO and MOSI) lines. The board is designed to use either a 3.3V or a 5V power supply (regulated by the 
on-board J1 jumper which is soldered to the 3.3V position by default).
